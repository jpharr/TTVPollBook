Changes in Scandit SDK 2.3.0M1 March 6th 2013

* Added support for the MSI Plessey symbology

* Improved robustness of barcode detection. This software update improves the scanning performance of small barcodes of limited height. 

* Added new API method that allows developers to choose keyboard type in search bar (numeric, alphanumeric). In previous releases, the Scandit SDK search bar only supported a numeric keyboard. 

Changes in Scandit SDK 2.2.7 January 18th 2013

* Software update to resolve missing "beep" introduced in version 2.2.5. 

Changes in Scandit SDK 2.2.6 January 14th 2013

* Software update to resolve rare registration issues related to OpenUDID implementation. 

* Software update to fix bug when switching from front to back camera by deallocating and reallocating ScanditSDKBarcodePicker. In the previous implementation, all configuration settings were lost. 

Changes in Scandit SDK 2.2.5 December 19th 2012

* Changed previous "greedy" implementation of the audio sound played when a successful 
scan happened. We had reports that once the Scandit SDK was instantiated, it was no longer 
possible to receive data from the audio port. 

* Added support for GS1 QR codes. GS1 QR codes are now returned using the symbology 
identifier GS1-QR. 

* Fixed a bug related to the "Search Bar Cancel" button. Long button titles were previously shortened. In this new version, the size of the button is increased. 

* Fixed a problem where the optional toolbar was sometimes placed at the wrong location.

* Changed implementation of the ScanditSDKRotatingBarcodePicker in the demo project to only support the orientations set in the project settings.

Changes in Scandit SDK 2.2.4 October 16th 2012

* Important software update which addresses autofocus delay under iOS6. 
The latest iOS6 release has a modified mechanism to trigger the autofocus 
which is slower than the iOS5 implementation. We introduced our own algorithm 
that triggers the autofocus more rapidly. 

* Fixed bug in Code128 and Datamatrix implementation that did not correctly 
decode GS1-128 and GS1-Datamatrix subtypes and used a misleading key for CODE128 in 
the results dictionary.  
IMPORTANT: Note that this bug fix has important implications if you 
are using the Code-128 or Datamatrix barcoder decoder today (see note below).

* Software update to address orientation issue under iOS6. In landscape mode 
the camera image was not displayed correctly if the app did not lock the 
orientation to portrait mode.  This is only relevant for applications that 
operated in portrait and landscape mode and also enabled scanning in landscape 
mode. 

* Fixed bug in QR decoder that resulted in "Umlaut"-character not being 
decoded correctly. 

* Eliminated warning message in demo app after iOS6 update.

* Adjusted size of UI in demo application for iPhone 5.

IMPORTANT NOTE for Code128 and Datamatrix barcode users: 
In previous versions, the Scandit SDK implementation disregarded the FC1 symbol. 
As a result, developers could not detect that a particular Code128 was in effect
 a GS1-128 code and/or the end of variable length fields of GS1-128 codes. 
The same applies to GS1 Datamatrix codes. This new release of the Scandit SDK 
now returns GS1-128 and GS1-Datamatrix codes with the keyword "GS1-128" and 
"GS1-DATAMATRIX" respectively. Non-GS1 128 codes are returned as CODE128 (previously EAN128). 
Variable length fields are terminated by ASCII symbol 29 ('GS'). If you 
have previously used the keywords "CODE128" or "DATAMATRIX", you will
 need to consider adjusting your code based on the above.
